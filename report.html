    <h1> Report Draft </h1>
   <p> Information about how I currently plan the report to look like </p>
   
   <h2> Draft: Outline </h2>
	<ol class="reportList">
	
	<li>Current Situation</li>
	Writing about the numbers and facts of voting in Germany, Koblenz: <br> 
		- "Wahlbeteiligung"<br> 
		- How people vote, report from Votes from 2019<br> 
		- How votes have changed<br> 
		- Rezos CDU Video, reached millions of voters, might have affected the reduction of votes in CDU <br>
		- How talking with others, many were confused whom to vote for<br> 
		- Political Parties became very diverse, the Opinions change often, there are different Kandidates representing different interests and different points of view<br>
	
	
   	<li>The Problem</li>
   	- Hypothesis: Can applicable Information Management change(improve) the Results of Votes? <br>
   	- Improve in the sence make voters more satisfied with their vote? <br>
   	- Information for Voting is hard to gather online, especially for small kommunal votes <br>
   	- People barely have time to inform themselves in the busy days <br>
   	- there is an online tool called "Wahl-o-mat", used quite often, but it only showes the resulting party <br>
   	
   	
   	<li>Sulution idea of this paper</li>
   	A tool that shows all the candidates from one area as a List<br>
   	The Candidates can be filtered by specific properties <br>
   	e. g.: <br>
   	- the party<br>
   	- the age <br>
   	- the gender <br>
   	- the academic title <br>
   	- the admisistrative area <br>
   	- the interests as hashtags <br>
   	
   	
   	<li>The system</li>
   	A Databank that stores all the Candidates Information, being <br>
   	- the party<br>
   	- the number on the list in the party<br>
   	- the title<br>
   	- the gender<br>
   	- the first name<br>
   	- the last name<br>
   	- the age <br>
   	- the picture as jpeg or png (link)<br>
   	- a free text (profession, political engagement)<br>
   	- hashtags generated from the free text<br>
   	- the administrative area <br>
	<br>
	Note: Use Delfmanns Unification using Vectors and unify them with a Thesaurus and TF/IDF <br>
	in order to to get Hashtags and unify them <br>
   	
   	
   	<li>The survey</li>
   	Find out using the survey, if: 
   	- What people thing about the voting process in general<br>
   	- If people would appreciate and profit from voting information management  <br>
   	- If people like a tool like this and if it has the potential to change the voting results <br>
   	<br>
   	
   	Ask a significant amount of people, pilot maybe 5 people <br>
   	1. Part: find out how voting was for the participants this year <br>
   	e. g. <br>
   	- did you vote? (yes, no)<br>
   	
   	- If yes, how did you vote? (booth, "Briefwahl")<br>
   		
   	- How did you vote? (specific Candidates, the whole party, according to the academin title, none of the above)<br>
   	
   	- How much time did you invest in the voting process (inform yourself upfront, in the booth) <br>
   	
   	- How do you like the voting process / decision making process? (easy, frustrating) <br>
   	<br>
   	
   	2. Part: Let participants choose some Kandidates or ask them to choose 56 Kandidates <br>
   	- guide them through the tool <br>
   	- let them use the tool <br>
   	- let them print out the result if the want, on send it per email <br>
   	<br>
   	
   	3. Part: Get the participants impression<br>
   	- If paricipants did not go voting, would they change their mind with this?<br>
   	- How was the process with this tool? Still long/frustrating??<br>
   	- Likert Skale: how different is it approx. from your original voting from this year?<br>
   	- Would you use a tool like this for your next vote?/ How helpful was it for you(likert scale)<br>
   	- Demographics of the Participant<br>
   	
   	
   	<li>Survey Result & Analysis</li>
   	- display the results of these questions 
   	- Significance tests?
   	
   	<li>Discussing the survey Results</li>
   	- Point our what was different from the Assumption<br>
   	- Was there a significant results that supports the fact that it changing the voting results?
   	- Was there a significant amout of participants who find the tool helpful / would use it again?
   	
   	<li>Possible Future Aspects</li>
   	- Parties import their candidate information (evtl. mass Import with .CSV?) -> All the information gathered in one place<br>
   	- Querry on website: Postalcode,  directs the voters directly to the right candidates <br>
   	- Prevoting analysis with anonymously collected data <br>
   	- Smartphone app: helps you vote even in the booth?<br>
   	- Apply Cryptography to make it more reliable<br>
   	
   	<li>Limitations</li>
   	- security <br>
   	- maintenance <br>
   	- would still lead to no desired results <br>
   	
   	<li>Conclusion</li>
   	I will make my conclustion at the end of the project
