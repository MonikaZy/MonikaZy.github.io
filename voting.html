    <h1> Voting Project </h1>
   <p>Do you know the feeling when the local votes start again and you certainly do not know whom to vote for? Ohhh, 56 votes to give to candidates, those are just too many and unfortunately most of them are neither on twitter nor on the news. So you just vote for an entire party and/or some people who have a PhD. 
    <br><br>
    This exact problem seems to be faced by many people, at least the majority of people I have asked so far about the local votings. Even though there is some information about the candidates on the websites, who has time to read all of the texts? 
    <br><br>
    Would it not be easier to aggregate the information about all the candidates available to choose from and make it easily accessible. filterable and also saveable? This is what this project is about and this (kind of) is what I would like to call my topic in my bachelor thesis: 
    
    </p> 
    <p style="text-align: center; font-weight: 600" >  “Is it possible to improve the voting experience using an information management tool?”
    </p> 
   <p> 
       (or something like that….) <br><br>
       I want to create a data bank with all the information about candidates I can find and organize. Following that I want to build the website and display the canditates and their information like articles in an online shop, and include the function to save them like a shopping cart, that would be printable in the end. I want to include filters and the possibility to sort and search, so finding the things the users are looking for will be even easier. 
       <br> <br> In the meantime I want to gather important information from "good" resources about that topic and write broadly what my thesis should include. 
       <br><br> 
       Very early I would also like to do a pilot survey and make the participants use the website. <br>
